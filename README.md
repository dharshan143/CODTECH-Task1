Overview Of the Project 


Certainly! Here's a simple Python program for a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /):

. **Functions for Operations**: The program defines four functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively.
  
2. **User Interface**: The program provides a simple command-line interface where the user can select the operation they want to perform (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) by entering the corresponding number (1, 2, 3, or 4).

3. **Input Handling**: 
   - It takes two numbers as input from the user for performing the selected operation.
   - It checks if the user's input for the operation choice is valid (i.e., '1', '2', '3', or '4'). If not, it prompts the user again until a valid choice is entered.

4. **Error Handling**: 
   - The program checks for division by zero in the `divide` function to avoid runtime errors.

5. **Output**: 
   - After performing the selected operation, the program prints the result.

This program handles basic arithmetic operations and includes basic input validation to ensure it operates correctly based on user input.
